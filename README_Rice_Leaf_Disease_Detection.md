# üåæ Rice Leaf Disease Detection


## üìñ Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based image classification system for detecting three major rice leaf diseases:
- **Leaf Blast**
- **Bacterial Blight**
- **Brown Spot**

The system uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning to classify leaf images into the above categories with high accuracy.

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset contains images of rice leaves collected from multiple sources.  
Each image is labeled according to the disease type.  
Classes include:
- **Leaf Blast**
- **Bacterial Blight**
- **Brown Spot**

Data augmentation techniques are applied to improve generalization.

# PRCP-1001: Rice Leaf Disease Detection

# **Project Introduction:**
Rice is one of the major cultivated crops in India. Rice crops are susceptible to various diseases at various stages of cultivation. Early detection and remedy is required to maintain the best quality and quantity in rice. Farmers with their limited knowledge, have a difficult time identifying these diseases manually. Therefore automated image recognition systems using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be very beneficial in such problems.

# **Classification Problem:**
Our goal is to build a model that would automatically classify rice leaf diseases. For this, we have taken three major attacking diseases in rice plants like leaf blast, bacterial blight and brown spot. We created a model that would determine if the future data inputs will fall in either of these 3 diseases- leaf,blast, bacterial blight and brown spot.

# **Conclusion**
Based on the given objectives the dataset has been analysed,the model has been built and the results have been predicted with the test data.The CNN Machine learning model has been fitted and predicted with high accuracy.Also, we observed that by adjusting the training parameters like learning rate, number of epochs, and optimizer methods, we can get significant accuracy with a handmade model having less number of layers than the other traditional models. The better we can detect infections, the simpler it will be for farmers to protect their crops. In the future, we will broaden the scope to include more diseases and algorithms, making disease detection vast, easier and faster.
